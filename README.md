# Winnipeg Transit Wait Times Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a dashboard for Winnipeg Transit to analyze bus on-time performance. The dashboard helps stakeholders gain insights into bus routes and stops with frequent delays or early arrivals, ultimately assisting in urban planning and improving the overall efficiency of Winnipeg's transit system.

## Features

The dashboard provides key metrics and visualizations based on Winnipeg Transit data. These metrics include:
- **On-time Performance (%):** The percentage of buses arriving on time.
- **Average Delay (in seconds):** The average delay for buses across different routes.
- **Average Early Arrival (in seconds):** The average time buses arrive earlier than scheduled.
- **Count of Late Buses:** The number of buses that arrived late.
- **Max and Min Delay:** The maximum and minimum delay recorded for each bus route.
- **Average Delay by Day:** Insights into delay trends for each day of the week.
- **Delay in Hours by Day:** Cumulative delay time in hours per day.
- **Average Delay by Month:** Trends for average delays across different months.
- **Average Delay and Early Arrival by Time of Day:** Breakdown of delay and early arrival data based on different time periods of the day.

## Key Insights and Filters

The dashboard allows users to apply a range of filters to focus on specific data points:
- **Month and Year:** Users can analyze performance for specific time periods.
- **Time of Day:** Insights can be filtered by different times (morning, afternoon, evening).
- **Bus Route Number:** Users can select specific bus routes to review performance data.
- **Route Destination:** Helps to analyze if specific destinations are more prone to delays.

## Data Source

The dataset was extracted from Winnipeg Transit Open Data, consisting of over 5 million data points. The data required extensive cleaning and manipulation to ensure accuracy and consistency in reporting.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: The main tool used for building the dashboard and data visualizations.
- **Python (NumPy, Pandas)**: Used for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Additional visualizations for exploratory data analysis.

## Project Impact

The dashboard provides Winnipeg Transit with actionable insights, highlighting routes and stops with consistent delays. The visualizations and data help urban planners and transit authorities make informed decisions about resource allocation, schedule adjustments, and long-term infrastructure planning.
